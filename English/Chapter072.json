{"id":"72","name":"The Jinn","verse":{"count":28,"data":{"1":"SAY: \"I HAVE been informed that a number of jinns had listened; then said: \u00b4We have heard the wondrous Qur\u00b4an, ","2":"Which guides to the right path; and we have come to believe in it, and will not associate any one with our Lord. ","3":"Exalted is the glory of our Lord; He has neither wife nor son. ","4":"Certainly the foolish among us say preposterous things of God. ","5":"We had in fact thought that men and jinns would never speak a lie about God, ","6":"But some men used to seek refuge with some jinns, and this increased their waywardness; ","7":"So they began to think, even as you do, that God would not resurrect any one. ","8":"We sought to pry into the secrets of the heavens, but found it full of fierce guards and shooting flames. ","9":"We sat in observatories to listen; but any one who listened found a shooting star in wait for him. ","10":"We do not know if this means ill for the dwellers of the earth, or their Lord wishes guidance for them. ","11":"For some of us are upright and some otherwise: Surely we follow different ways. ","12":"We realised that we could not weaken the power of God on earth, nor outpace Him by running away. ","13":"So when we heard the guidance we believed in it; and he who believes in his Lord will neither fear loss nor force. ","14":"Some of us have come to submission, and some of us are iniquitous.\u00b4\" Those who have submitted have taken the right course; ","15":"But those who are iniquitous will be fuel for Hell. ","16":"(Say): \"If they keep to the right path We shall give them water in abundance to drink ","17":"In order to try them through it. But whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, will be given increasing torment by Him.\" ","18":"All places of worship are for God; so do not invoke any one with God. ","19":"When the devotee of God stood up to invoke Him (the jinns) crowded upon him (to listen).","20":"Say: \"I call on my Lord alone and I do not associate any one with Him.\"","21":"Say: \"Neither is your loss within my power nor bringing you to guidance.\" ","22":"Say: \"No one can save me from God, nor can I find a place of refuge apart from Him, ","23":"Unless I convey from God and deliver His message.\" For those who disobey God and His Apostle is the fire of Hell, where they will abide for ever; ","24":"Until they see what they are promised, when they will understand who is weaker in aid and poorer in numbers. ","25":"Say: \"I do not know if what is promised you is near, or if my Lord prolongs its term. ","26":"He is the knower of the Unknown, and He does not divulge His secret to any one ","27":"Other than an apostle He has chosen, when He makes a sentinel walk in front of him and a sentinel behind, ","28":"So that He may know if they have delivered their Lord\u00b4s messages. He comprehends all that has been given them, and keeps count of everything. "}}}
