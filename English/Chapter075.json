{"id":"75","name":"The Resurrection","verse":{"count":40,"data":{"1":"I CALL TO WITNESS the Day of Resurrection, ","2":"And I call the reprehensive soul to witness: ","3":"Does man think We shall not put his bones together? ","4":"Surely We are able to reform even his finger-tips. ","5":"Yet man is sceptical of what is right before him. ","6":"He asks: \"When will the Day of Resurrection be?\" ","7":"Yet when the eyes are dazzled, ","8":"The moon eclipsed, ","9":"And the sun and moon are conjoined, ","10":"That day man will say: \"Where can I find escape?\" ","11":"Never so, for there will be no escape. ","12":"With your Lord alone will be the retreat on that day. ","13":"Then man will be told what he had sent ahead (of good) and what he had left behind. ","14":"In fact man is a witness against himself, ","15":"Whatever the excuses he may offer. ","16":"Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. ","17":"Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. ","18":"So, as We recite it, follow its reading. ","19":"The exposition of its meaning surely rests on Us. ","20":"But no. You love this transient life, ","21":"And neglect the Hereafter. ","22":"How many faces will be refulgent on that Day, ","23":"Waiting for their Lord. ","24":"And how many faces on that Day will be woe-begone ","25":"Fearing that a great disaster is going to befall them. ","26":"Never so, for when life withdraws into the clavicula, ","27":"And it is asked: \"Is there any reciter of charms and amulets?\" ","28":"He will then realise it is the parting, ","29":"And anguish will be heaped upon anguish: ","30":"To your Lord then will be the driving.","31":"For he neither believed nor prayed,","32":"But only disavowed and turned away; ","33":"Then he strutted back to his people. ","34":"Alas the woe for you, alas! ","35":"Alas, the woe for you! ","36":"Does man think that he will be left alone to himself, free? ","37":"Was he not an emitted drop of semen, ","38":"Then formed into an embryo? Then He fashioned, shaped and proportioned ","39":"And assigned it sexes, male and female. ","40":"Cannot such as He bring the dead to life? "}}}
