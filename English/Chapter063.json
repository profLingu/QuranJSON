{"id":"63","name":"The Hypocrites","verse":{"count":11,"data":{"1":"WHEN THE HYPOCRITES come to you, they say: \"We affirm that you are the Apostle of God.\" God indeed knows you are His Apostle. God bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars. ","2":"They have made their oaths a shield in order to obstruct others from the way of God. It is certainly evil what they do. ","3":"That is because they came to believe, and then renounced (their faith). So their hearts were sealed; and now they do not understand. ","4":"Pleasing seem their persons when you look at them; and when they talk, you listen to their speech. Yet they are like the wooden panelling of a wall. They imagine every rebuke to be directed against them. They are the enemies, beware of them. May God damn them, how pervert are they! ","5":"When you tell them: \"Come, let the Apostle of God ask forgiveness for you,\" they turn their heads, and you see them turning away with arrogance. ","6":"Whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask, it is all the same; God will not forgive them. Surely God does not show a disobedient people the way. ","7":"They are the ones who say: \"Do not spend on those who are with the Apostle of God till they break away (from him).\" To God belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites do not understand. ","8":"They say: \"If we now go back to Madina, the stronger will turn the weaker out.\" But power belongs to God, His Apostle and the faithful, though the hypocrites do not know. ","9":"O you who believe, let not your wealth and children make you negligent of the remembrance of God. Those who do so will be losers. ","10":"Spend of what We have given you before death comes to one of you, when he will say: \"O Lord, why did you not defer my term for a while that I could give alms and be among the doers of good?\" ","11":"But God does not grant a soul respite once its term has come to end. And God is aware of what you do. "}}}
