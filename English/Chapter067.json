He is all-mighty and forgiving, ","3":"Who created the seven skies one above the other. Do you see any disproportion in the creations of Ar-Rahman? Turn your eyes again. Do you see any fissures? ","4":"Turn your eyes again and again. Your gaze turns back dazed and tired. ","5":"We have adorned the lowest sky with lamps, and made them missiles against the devils, for whom We have prepared a torment of most intense fire. ","6":"For those who believe not in their Lord there is the punishment of Hell; and what a wretched destination ","7":"When they are cast into it, they will hear it roar and raging ","8":"As though it would burst with fury. Every time a crowd is thrown into it, its wardens will ask: \"Did no warner come to you?\" ","9":"And they will answer: \"Surely; a warner came to us, but we denied him, and said: \u00b4God did not send down any thing; you are greatly deluded, in fact.\u00b4\" ","10":"They will say: \"If we had listened and been wise, we would not have been among the inmates of Hell.\" ","11":"So will they confess their guilt. Deprived (of all joys) will be the inmates of Hell. ","12":"For those who fear their Lord in secret is forgiveness and a great reward.","13":"Whether you say a thing secretly or openly, He knows the innermost secrets of your hearts. ","14":"Can He who has created not know (His creation)? He is all-penetrating, all-aware. ","15":"It is lie who made the earth subservient to you that you may travel all around it, and eat of things He has provided; and to Him will be your resurrection. ","16":"Are you so unafraid that He who is in Heaven will not open up the earth to swallow you, when it will begin to tremble? ","17":"Or have you become so unafraid that He who is in Heaven will not send a violent wind to shower stones at you? Then you will know the import of My commination! ","18":"Those before them had also denied. And how was My punishment then! ","19":"Do they not see the birds above them flying wings spread out or folded? Nothing holds them aloft but God. All things are within His purview. ","20":"What other army do you have to help you apart from Ar-Rahman? The unbelievers are surely lost in delusion. ","21":"Who is there to give you food in case He withholds His bounty? Yet they persist in rebellion and aversion. ","22":"Will he find the way who grovels flat on his face, or he who walks straight on the right path? ","23":"Say: \"It is He who raised you and gave you ears and eyes and hearts. How little are the thanks you offer!\" ","24":"Say: \"It is He who dispersed you all over the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.\" ","25":"But they say: \"When will this promise come to pass, if what you say is true?\" ","26":"Say: \"God alone has knowledge. My duty is only to warn you clearly.\" ","27":"When they realise it has come upon them, distraught will be the faces of unbelievers. They will be told: \"This is what you asked for.\" ","28":"Say: \"Just think: If God destroys me and those with me, or is benevolent to us, who will then protect the unbelievers from a painful doom?\" ","29":"Say: \"He is the benevolent; in Him do we believe, and in Him do we place our trust. You will now realise who is in manifest error.\" ","30":"Say: \"Just think: If your water were to dry up in the morning who will bring you water from a fresh, flowing stream?\" "}}}
