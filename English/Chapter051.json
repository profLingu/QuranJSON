{"id":"51","name":"The Scatterers","verse":{"count":60,"data":{"1":"I CALL TO witness those who scatter (dust) by dispersing, ","2":"And those who bear the load (of rain), ","3":"And those who move (on the water) gently, ","4":"And those who distribute (it) by command, ","5":"Verily the promise made to you is true: ","6":"The Judgement will indeed take place. ","7":"The heavens webbed-with-tracks is witness ","8":"You are surely caught in contradictions., ","9":"From which only he turns who is turned away. ","10":"Perish will those who just guess and speculate, ","11":"Who are lost in deception. ","12":"They ask: \"When is the Day of Judgement?\" -- ","13":"The day they will be burnt in the Fire, ","14":"(And told:) \"Taste your punishment. This is what you were trying to hasten.\" ","15":"Surely those who fear God and follow the straight path will be amidst gardens and fresh springs of water, ","16":"Receiving what is given them by their Lord. They were surely the virtuous before this. ","17":"They slept little in the night, ","18":"And every morning asked forgiveness, ","19":"In whose wealth the suppliant and the deprived had a share. ","20":"There are signs in the earth for those who are firm in their faith, ","21":"And within yourselves. Can you not perceive? ","22":"There is in the heavens your sustenance, and whatever has been promised you. ","23":"By the Lord of the heavens and the earth, this is certainly true even as you speak. ","24":"Has the story of Abraham\u00b4s honoured guests come to you? ","25":"When they came to him, they said: \"Peace.\" He answered: \"Peace.\" They were a people he did not recognise. ","26":"So he hurried to the house and brought a fatted calf, ","27":"And placing it before them said: \"Won\u00b4t you eat?\" ","28":"He felt afraid of them; but they said: \"Have no fear,\" and gave him the good news of a wise son. ","29":"His wife came out lamenting, striking her forehead, and said: \"I, am old and barren woman?\" ","30":"They said: \"Thus said your Lord. He is indeed all-wise and all-knowing.\" ","31":"He said: \"What is then your business, O messengers?\" ","32":"They said: \"We have been sent to a wicked people ","33":"So as to let loose clods of clay on them ","34":"Marked by your Lord for those who waste their substance.\" ","35":"So We evacuated everyone who was a believer there, ","36":"But did not find more than a single family of believers. ","37":"We left a sign in this for those who fear the grievous punishment, ","38":"As (there was) in Moses when We sent him to the Pharaoh with clear authority. ","39":"But he turned to his counsellors, and said: \"He is a magician or lunatic.\" ","40":"So We seized him and his armies, and threw them into the sea, for he was worthy of blame. ","41":"In \u00b4Ad (also is a sign), when We sent a blasting wind against them, ","42":"Which turned everything it touched to ashes. ","43":"And in Thamud, when We said to them: \"Enjoy yourselves for a while;\" ","44":"But they disobeyed the command of their Lord; so they were destroyed by a thunderbolt, and they could only gape, ","45":"And neither stand up nor defend themselves. ","46":"(So had We destroyed) the people of Noah before them: They were surely a sinful people. ","47":"We built the heavens by Our authority; and We are the Lord of power and expanse. ","48":"We spread the earth a carpet; what comfort We provide! ","49":"And We created pairs of everything that you may contemplate. ","50":"So turn to God. I give you a clear warning from Him. ","51":"Do not set up another god with God. I give you a clear warning from Him. ","52":"Even thus no apostle came to those before them but they said: \"He is a sorcerer or a mad man.\" ","53":"Is this the legacy they have passed down from one to the other? In fact, they are a rebellious people. ","54":"Turn away from them. You will not be blamed. ","55":"But go on reminding them, as reminding benefits the believers. ","56":"I have not created the jinns and men but to worship Me. ","57":"I want no sustenance from them nor do I want them to feed Me. ","58":"God is certainly the great provider, Lord of strength and power. ","59":"Those who do wrong will indeed come to the same end as their fellows (of old). So let them not ask Me to hasten (the punishment). ","60":"Alas the woe for those who refuse to believe in the Day which has been promised them. "}}}
