{"id":"69","name":"The Sure Calamity","verse":{"count":52,"data":{"1":"THE CONCRETE REALITY. ","2":"What is the concrete reality? ","3":"What do you comprehend by the concrete reality? ","4":"The Thamud and \u00b4Ad denied the consequential calamity. ","5":"So destroyed were the Thamud by a storm of thunder and lightning; ","6":"And the \u00b4Ad were destroyed by the furious cold blast of roaring wind ","7":"Which He sent to assail them for seven nights and eight days running. You should have seen the people prostrate like the decayed trunks of date-palm trees. ","8":"Do you see any trace of them? ","9":"Then came the Pharaoh, and those before him whose habitations were overthrown while they were committing crimes. ","10":"When they disobeyed the apostle of their Lord He seized them with an overwhelming punishment. ","11":"When the water rose in flood, We bore you in the ark, ","12":"In order to make it a warning for you, and that the ear retentive may preserve it. ","13":"When the single blast is sounded on the trumpet, ","14":"And the earth and mountains heaved and crushed to powder with one levelling blow, ","15":"On that Day will come what is to come. ","16":"The sky will cleave asunder on that day and fall to pieces. ","17":"On its fringes will be angels, eight of them, bearing their Lord\u00b4s throne aloft. ","18":"You will then be set before Him, and not one of you will remain unexposed. ","19":"He who is given his ledger in his right hand, will say: \"Here, read my ledger. ","20":"I was certain I\u00b4ll be given my account.\" ","21":"So he shall have an agreeable life ","22":"In high empyrean ","23":"With fruits hanging low within reach, ","24":"(And told:) \"Eat and drink to your fill as reward for (good) deeds you had done in days of yore.\" ","25":"But whosoever gets his ledger in his left hand, will say: \"Would that I were never given my ledger, ","26":"And not known my account! ","27":"I wish death had put an end to me. ","28":"Of no use was even my wealth. ","29":"Vanished has my power from me.\" ","30":"\"Seize him and manacle him, ","31":"Then cast him to be burnt in Hell; ","32":"And string him to a chain seventy cubits long. ","33":"He did not believe in God the supreme, ","34":"Nor urged others to feed the poor. ","35":"That is why he has no friend today, ","36":"Nor food other than suppuration (filth) ","37":"Which none but the hellish eat.\" ","38":"So, I call to witness what you see ","39":"And what you do not see, ","40":"That this is indeed the word of the noble Messenger, ","41":"And not the word of a poet. How little is it that you believe! ","42":"Nor is it the word of a soothsayer. Little is it that you reflect! ","43":"It has been sent down by the Lord of all the worlds. ","44":"Had he attributed falsely any words to Us, ","45":"We would have seized him by his right hand, ","46":"Then cut off his aorta, ","47":"And not one of you would have been able to stop (Us). ","48":"It is really a reminder for those who fear God and follow the straight path. ","49":"We certainly know that some among you do deny it. ","50":"It is surely the nemesis of unbelievers.
