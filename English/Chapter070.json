","8":"The day the sky becomes like molten brass, ","9":"The mountains like the tufts of (carded) wool, ","10":"And no friend inquires after friend ","11":"Though within sight of one another. The sinner would like to ransom himself from the torment of that Day by offering his sons, ","12":"His wife and his brother, ","13":"And his family who had stood by him, ","14":"And all those who are on the earth, to save himself. ","15":"But never. It is pure white flame ","16":"That would skin the scalp. ","17":"It will summon whoever turns his back and flees, ","18":"Who amasses and then hoards.
