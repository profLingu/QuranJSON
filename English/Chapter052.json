","13":"The day they are dragged and pushed into Hell, ","14":"(And told:) \"This is the fire which you denied. ","15":"Is it magic, or you cannot see? ","16":"Roast in it. Bear it with patience or impatience, it will be the same for you. You will be requited for what you had done.\" ","17":"Those who fear God and follow the straight path will surely be in gardens and in bliss, ","18":"Rejoicing at what their Lord has given them; and their Lord will preserve them from the torment of Hell. ","19":"\"Eat and drink with relish,\" (they will be told), (as recompense) for what you had done.\" ","20":"They would recline on couches set in rows, paired with fair companions (clean of thought and) bright of eye. ","21":"And those who believed, and whose progeny also followed them in their faith, will be united with their offspring. We will not deprive them of their labour in the least.

","29":"Remind them, therefore, that by the grace of your Lord you are neither a soothsayer nor possessed. ","30":"Do they say: \"He is a poet for whom we expect an adverse turn of fortune?\" ","31":"Tell them: \"Keep on expecting, I am expecting with you.\" ","32":"Does their reasoning prompt them to this, or they are a people rebellious?
