{"id":"26","name":"The Poets","verse":{"count":227,"data":{"1":"TA SIN MIM. ","2":"These are the verses of the perspicuous Book. ","3":"You may perhaps wear out your heart because they do not come to belief. ","4":"We could send down from the heavens a sign to them if We pleased, before which their heads would remain bowed. ","5":"Never does a new reminder come to them from Ar-Rahman but they turn away from it. ","6":"Surely they have done with denying; soon will come to them the news of what they were laughing at. ","7":"Do they not see the earth, how We grow all kinds of noble things upon it? ","8":"Verily there are signs in this; yet many of them do not believe. ","9":"Your Lord is surely mighty and merciful. ","10":"When your Lord called upon Moses: \"Go to the wicked people, ","11":"The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear and take heed?\" ","12":": He said: \"O Lord, I fear that they will deny me. ","13":"My heart is constrained, my tongue falters, so delegate Aaron; ","14":"And they have a charge (of murder) against me. So I fear that they will kill me.\" ","15":"(It was) said: \"By no means. Go with My signs, both of you. I am verily with you and I hear. ","16":"Go to the Pharaoh and tell him: \u00b4We bring a message from the Lord of all the worlds ","17":"That you should send the children of Israel with us.\u00b4 ","18":"(The Pharaoh) said: \"Did we not bring you up as a child? And you lived a number of years of your life with us. ","19":"And you commited what you did, and you are ungrateful!\" ","20":"(Moses) replied: \"I did do that and I was in the wrong, ","21":"So I ran away from you out of fear. But my Lord has given me wisdom, and made me an apostle. ","22":"But the favour you oblige me with is that you have enslaved the children of Israel.\" ","23":"The Pharaoh asked: \"And what is the Lord of all the worlds?\" ","24":"(Moses) said: \"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, if you can believe.\" ","25":"(The Pharaoh) said to those around him: \"Do you hear?\" ","26":"(Moses continued): \"Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers before you.\" ","27":"(The Pharaoh) said (to his nobles): \"Your apostle who has been sent to you, is certainly mad.\" ","28":"(Moses) said: \"The Lord of the East and the Lord of the West and all that lies between them, if you have sense.\" ","29":"(The Pharaoh) said: \"If you took another god apart from me I will have you incarcerated.\" ","30":"(Moses) said: \"Even though I have brought to you something convincing?\" ","31":"(The Pharaoh) said: \"Then bring it, if you speak the truth.\" ","32":"So (Moses) cast his staff, and lo, it turned into a living serpent. ","33":"And he drew forth his hand, and lo, it looked white to the beholders.","34":"The Pharaoh said to the chiefs around him: \"He is certainly a clever magician.","35":"He wants to drive you out of your land by his magic. So, what do you bid?\" ","36":"They said: \"Put him and his brother off awhile, and send summoners to the cities to gather ","37":"And bring the ablest magicians to you.\" ","38":"So the magicians were assembled at a stated time and place on an appointed day. ","39":"And the people were also asked to assemble. ","40":"(They said): \"We may haply follow the magicians if they are victorious.\" ","41":"When the magicians arrived, they said to the Pharaoh: \"Is there a reward for us if we are victorious?\" -- ","42":"\"Yes,\" he replied. \"You \u00b4will be among the honoured.\" ","43":"Moses said to them: \"Cast what you have to cast.\" ","44":"So they cast their ropes and rods, and said: \"By the glory of Pharaoh, we shall be victorious.\" ","45":"Then Moses threw down his staff, and lo, it swallowed up their conjurations. ","46":"Then the magicians fell prostrating in adoration, ","47":"And said: \"We (affirm and) believe in the Lord of all the worlds, ","48":"The Lord of Moses and Aaron.\" ","49":"Said (the Pharaoh): \"You have come to believe in him before I gave you leave. He is surely your chief, who taught you magic. You will soon come to know: I will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, and have every one of you crucified.\" ","50":"They said: \"There will be no harm. We shall return to our Lord. ","51":"We certainly hope our Lord will forgive our sins as we are the first to believe.\"","52":"We said to Moses: \"Travel by night with My creatures. You will surely be pursued.\"","53":"Then the Pharaoh sent announcers to the cities, ","54":"(Proclaiming): \"Surely they are a small band (of fugitives). ","55":"They are always harassing us. ","56":"But we are a fully accounted army.\" ","57":"So We made them leave the gardens and springs of water, ","58":"And treasures and agreeable mansions. ","59":"Thus it was; and We made the children of Israel possess them. ","60":"But they pursued them at sunrise. ","61":"When the two forces drew within seeing distance of each other, the people of Moses said: \"We shall certainly be overtaken.\" ","62":"Moses replied: \"By no means. My Lord is with me. He will show me the way.\" ","63":"We commanded Moses: \"Smite the sea with your staff.\" And it parted, and every parting was like a lofty mountain. ","64":"Then We brought the others to that place. ","65":"We delivered Moses and every one with him, ","66":"And We drowned the others. ","67":"Verily there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe. ","68":"Indeed your Lord is mighty and merciful. ","69":"Relate the news of Abraham to them. ","70":"When he asked his father and his people: \"What do you worship?\" ","71":"They replied: \"We worship idols and are devoted to them.\" ","72":"(Abraham) asked: \"Do they hear when you call them? ","73":"Or do they benefit you, or do you harm?\" ","74":"They said: \"No. But we found our fathers doing so.\" ","75":"He said: \"Have you considered what you have been worshipping, ","76":"You and your fathers? ","77":"Yet they are my enemies except the Lord of all the worlds ","78":"Who created me and showed me the way, ","79":"Who gives me food and drink, ","80":"And heals me when I am sick, ","81":"Who will make me die, then give me life again, ","82":"And who, I hope, will condone my faults on the Day of Judgement. ","83":"O Lord, give me wisdom and admit me among the righteous, ","84":"And uphold my name with posterity, ","85":"And put me among the inheritors of Paradise. ","86":"Forgive me and my father: He was surely among those who went astray. ","87":"And do not disgrace me on the day when they are raised from the graves, ","88":"The day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail ","89":"But to him who comes to God with a tranquil heart.\" ","90":"Paradise will be brought near those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path; ","91":"And Hell made visible to those who had gone astray. ","92":"They will be asked: \"Where are those you worshipped ","93":"Other than God? Can they save you or even save themselves?\" ","94":"They will then be thrown into Hell with those who had gone astray ","95":"Together with the hordes of Iblis. ","96":"Disputing among themselves they will say: ","97":"\"By God, we were plainly in error ","98":"In equating you with the Lord of all the worlds; ","99":"No one but the sinners led us astray. ","100":"Now we have none to intercede for us, ","101":"Nor any sincere friend. ","102":"If only we could return and be among the believers!\" ","103":"Verily there is a sign in this, but many of them do not believe. ","104":"Verily your Lord is mighty and merciful.","105":"The people of Noah accused the apostles of lies. ","106":"When their brother Noah said to them: \"Will you not take heed? ","107":"I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you. ","108":"So be fearful of God and listen to me. ","109":"I ask no recompense of you for it. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds. ","110":"So fear God and follow me.\" ","111":"They said: \"Should we place our trust in you when only the condemned follow you?\" ","112":"He said: \"It is not for me to know what they were doing. ","113":"It is for my Lord to bring them to book, if you can understand. ","114":"I am certainly not one to drive away the believers. ","115":"I am only a plain admonisher.\" ","116":"They said: \"If you do not desist, O Noah, you will be stoned to death.\" ","117":"He prayed: \"O Lord, verily my people accuse me of lies. ","118":"So adjudge between me and them conclusively, and save me and the believers who are with me.\" ","119":"So We delivered him and those with him in the loaded ark, ","120":"And drowned the rest of them. ","121":"Verily there is a sign in this, yet many of them do not believe. ","122":"But surely your Lord is mighty and merciful.","123":"The people of \u00b4Ad accused the messengers of lies.","124":"When their brother Hud said to them: \"Will you not take heed? ","125":"I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you. ","126":"So fear God and listen to me. ","127":"I ask no recompense of you for it. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds. ","128":"You construct monuments on every hill in vain, ","129":"Erect palaces (thinking) that you will live for ever, ","130":"And whenever you apply force become tyrannical. ","131":"So be fearful of God and follow me. ","132":"Fear Him who has bestowed on you what you know, ","133":"Gave you increase of cattle and sons, ","134":"And orchards and springs. ","135":"I fear the punishment of a terrible day for you. ","136":"They said: \"It is the same to us if you warn us or do not warn. ","137":"This is just a habit of antiquated people. ","138":"We are not going to be damned.\" ","139":"Then they accused him of lies; so We annihilated them. Verily there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe. ","140":"Yet surely your Lord is mighty and merciful. ","141":"The Thamud accused the messengers of lies. ","142":"When their brother Saleh said to them: \"Will you not take heed?\" ","143":"I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you. ","144":"So fear God and follow me. ","145":"I do not ask any recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds. ","146":"(Do you think) you will be left secure here ","147":"In these gardens and these springs, ","148":"The fields of corn and date-palm trees with soft and tender spathes, ","149":"And dwellings hewed out of mountains ingeniously? ","150":"So be mindful of God and listen to me. ","151":"Do not follow those who are extravagant, ","152":"Who corrupt the land and do not reform it.\" ","153":"They said: \"Surely you are deluded. ","154":"You are nothing but a man like us. Bring us a token if you speak the truth.\" ","155":"(Saleh) said: \"Here is a she-camel. She has a right of drinking water, and you have a right of drinking it on appointed turns. ","156":"Do not treat her unkindly or the punishment of a grievous day will fall on you.\" ","157":"But they hamstrung her; and on the morrow were repentant, ","158":"For they were seized by the torment. Verily there was a sign in this, but most of them did not believe. ","159":"Yet verily your Lord is mighty and merciful. ","160":"The people of Lot accused the messengers of lies. ","161":"When their brother Lot said to them: \"Will you not take heed? ","162":"I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you. ","163":"So fear God and listen to me. ","164":"I ask no recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds. ","165":"Why do you go for males unlike all other creatures ","166":"Leaving the consorts your Lord has made for you? But you are a people who exceed the bounds.\" ","167":"They said: \"If you do not desist, O Lot, you will be expelled (from the city).\" ","168":"(Lot) said: \"I am disgusted with your actions,\" ","169":"(And prayed:) \"O Lord, save me and my family from what they do.\" ","170":"So We saved him and his whole family ","171":"Except one old woman who remained behind. ","172":"Then We destroyed the rest of them, ","173":"And rained on them a shower (of Stones). How terrible was the rain (that fell) on those who had been warned! ","174":"Verily in this was a sign, but most of them do not believe. ","175":"Yet surely your Lord is mighty and powerful.","176":"The people of the Wood too called the messengers liars. ","177":"When Shu\u00b4aib said to them: \"Will you not take heed? ","178":"I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you. ","179":"So fear God and follow me. ","180":"I ask no recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds. ","181":"Give full measure and do not cheat; ","182":"Weigh on an even balance. ","183":"And do not withhold from people what belongs to them, and do not corrupt the land; ","184":"And fear Him who created you and all the earlier people.\" ","185":"They said: \"Surely you are deluded. ","186":"You are nothing but a man like us, and we think you are a liar. ","187":"But in case you are speaking the truth, then make a segment of the sky to fall upon us.\" ","188":"(Shu\u00b4aib) said: \"My Lord knows well what you are doing.\" ","189":"But they denied him, and We seized them with the torment of the Day of Shadowing (when the cloud had rained down fire). It was indeed the torment of a terrible day! ","190":"Verily in this was a sign, but most of them do not believe. ","191":"Yet verily your Lord is mighty and merciful. ","192":"And this (Qur\u00b4an) is a revelation from the Lord of all the worlds, ","193":"Which the trusted spirit descended with ","194":"To (communicate) to your heart that you may be a warner ","195":"In eloquent Arabic. ","196":"This is (indicated) in the Books of earlier people. ","197":"Was it not a proof for them that the learned men of Israel knew about this? ","198":"Had We revealed it to a man of obscure tongue ","199":"And he had recited it to them, and they had not believed (it would have been different). ","200":"Thus do We cause (unbelief) to enter the hearts of sinners. ","201":"They will not believe it until they behold the painful punishment. ","202":"It will come upon them unawares, and they will not comprehend it. ","203":"Then will they say: \"Can we be given respite?\" ","204":"Do they wish Us then to hasten the punishment? ","205":"Just think: If We let them enjoy (the good things of life) for a few years more, ","206":"And then what they were promised comes upon them, ","207":"Of what avail shall their enjoyment be to them? ","208":"Never have We destroyed a habitation till We had sent admonishers to them ","209":"To warn. For We are never unjust. ","210":"The devils did not bring it down: ","211":"They are not worthy of it, nor have they power. ","212":"They have been precluded from hearing it. ","213":"So call on no other god but God, lest you are condemned to torment; ","214":"And warn your near relations, ","215":"And take those believers under your wing who follow you. ","216":"If they do not obey you, tell them: \"I am not responsible for what you do.\" ","217":"Have trust in the Mighty, the Merciful, ","218":"Who watches you when you get up, ","219":"And your movements among those who bow in homage to God. ","220":"He is all-hearing and all-knowing. ","221":"Should I tell you on whom the devils descend? ","222":"They come down to every mendacious sinner, ","223":"Who listens to you (for spreading rumours); but most of them are liars. ","224":"As for the poets, only those who go astray follow them. ","225":"Have you not seen that they wander distract in every valley, ","226":"And they say what they do not do, ","227":"Except those who believe and do the right, and remember God a great deal, who retaliate only when they have been wronged. Yet the oppressors will now come to know through what reversals they will be overthrown! "}}}
