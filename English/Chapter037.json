{"id":"37","name":"The Rangers","verse":{"count":182,"data":{"1":"I CALL TO witness those who stand arrayed in rows, ","2":"And those who restrain by reprimanding, ","3":"And those who recite the Reminder, ","4":"Verily your God is One, ","5":"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and the Lord of the Easts. ","6":"He decked the nearest heavens with ornaments of stars, ","7":"Protecting them against every wayward devil, ","8":"So that they are not able to listen to the angels of higher (echelons), and are pelted from all sides ","9":"And kept far away. There is perpetual punishment for them, ","10":"Except those who eavesdrop and are pursued by a shooting flame. ","11":"So ask them if they are more difficult to create, or the rest We have created? Indeed (man) We created from fermented clay. ","12":"Yet while you are filled with wonder, they just scoff; ","13":"And when they are warned they pay no heed. ","14":"When they see a sign, they laugh at it, ","15":"And say: \"This is only magic. ","16":"When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, how can we be raised again, ","17":"And our fathers too?\" ","18":"You say: \"Yes; and you will be lowly made.\" ","19":"There will only be a single jerk, and they will gape, ","20":"And say: \"Ah woe! This is the Day of Reckoning.\" ","21":"\"(Yes,) this is the Day of Judgement you had called a lie.\" ","22":"Gather all the wicked together and their comrades, and those they had worshipped ","23":"Other than God,\" (the angels will be told), \"then show them the way to Hell, ","24":"And detain them, for they will be questioned.\" ","25":"\"What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?\" ","26":"They will submit to questioning then, ","27":"And some of them will confront the others, ","28":"Saying: \"It were you who imposed yourselves upon us.\" ","29":"They will say: \"No, you were the ones who would not believe. ","30":"We had no power over you. In fact, you were a people rebellious. ","31":"The sentence of our Lord has come true for us. We have certainly to taste (the punishment), ","32":"For we had led you astray. In fact we ourselves were astray.\" ","33":"So, they will become partners in punishment. ","34":"That is how We deal with sinners. ","35":"They were those who, when it was said to them, \"There is no god but God,\" behaved with insolence, ","36":"And said: \"Should we abandon our gods for the sake of an insane poet?\" ","37":"Not in the least. He has brought the truth and confirmed the other messengers. ","38":"You will indeed taste a painful punishment, ","39":"And be rewarded but only for what you had done, ","40":"Except the chosen creatures of God, ","41":"Whose provision is predetermined -- ","42":"Fruits of every kind, and they will be honoured ","43":"In gardens of delight, ","44":"(Sitting) on couches, face to face, ","45":"With cups from a flowing stream being passed around, ","46":"Clear, delicious to drink, ","47":"Neither dulling the senses nor intoxicating, ","48":"And with them maidens of modest look and large lustrous eyes, ","49":"Like sheltered eggs in a nest. ","50":"Then one turned to the other in an enquiry. ","51":"Said one of the speakers: \"I had a friend ","52":"Who used to say: \u00b4Are you one of those who can testify to the truth? ","53":"(Do you think) we would be paid back our due when we are dead and reduced to dust and bones?\u00b4 ","54":"He said: \u00b4Will you look down?\u00b4 ","55":"He looked down and saw (his friend) in the midst of Hell. ","56":"\u00b4By God\u00b4, he said, \u00b4you had almost ruined me. ","57":"Had it not been for the grace of my Lord I too would have been there (in Hell). ","58":"(Another will say:)\"Is it true, we are not going to die ","59":"Other than our first death, and we shall not be punished? ","60":"This will indeed be great happiness. ","61":"For this the toilers should strive.\" ","62":"Is this better or the tree of Zaqqum ","63":"Which We have reserved as punishment for evil-doers? ","64":"It is a tree that grows at the bottom of Hell. ","65":"Its spathes are like the prickly pear. ","66":"They will eat and fill their bellies with it, ","67":"Washing it down with boiling water. ","68":"Then to Hell they will surely be returned. ","69":"They had found their fathers astray, ","70":"Yet they hasten to follow in their footsteps. ","71":"So had many an earlier people gone astray, ","72":"And We had sent admonishers to them. ","73":"Look, then how was the end of those who had been warned, ","74":"Other than the chosen creatures of God. ","75":"Noah had verily called to Us. And how gracious was He who answered (him). ","76":"We saved him and his family from the great affliction, ","77":"And made his progeny survive, ","78":"And left (his name) for posterity. ","79":"Peace on Noah among all men. ","80":"That is how We reward those who do good. ","81":"Surely he was among Our faithful creatures. ","82":"Afterwards We drowned the others. ","83":"And Abraham indeed was of his inducement, ","84":"When he came to his Lord with a heart compliant, ","85":"When he said to his father and his people: \"What is this you worship? ","86":"Why do you solicit false gods instead of God? ","87":"What do you imagine the Lord of the worlds to be?\" ","88":"Then he looked up at the stars (they worshipped), ","89":"And said: \"I am sick (of what you worship)!\" ","90":"But they turned their backs on him and went away. ","91":"Then he turned towards their gods and said: \"Why do you not eat (of these offerings)? ","92":"What is wrong with you that you do not speak?\" ","93":"Then he started striking them down with his right hand. ","94":"So the people descended upon him. ","95":"\"Why do you worship these you carve yourselves,\" he asked, ","96":"\"When God has created you and what you make?\" ","97":"\"Build a pyre for him and throw him into the raging fire.\" ","98":"So they contrived a plot against him, but We made them abject. ","99":"And he said: \"I am going away to my Lord who will show me the way. ","100":"(And he prayed:) \"O Lord, grant me a righteous son.\" ","101":"So We gave him the good news of a clement son. ","102":"When he was old enough to go about with him, he said: \"O my son, I dreamt that I was sacrificing you. Consider, what you think?\" He replied: \"Father, do as you are commanded. If God pleases you will find me firm.\" ","103":"When they submitted to the will of God, and (Abraham) laid (his son) down prostrate on his temple, ","104":"We called out: \"O Abraham, ","105":"You have fulfilled your dream.\" Thus do We reward the good. ","106":"That was indeed a trying test. ","107":"So We ransomed him for a great sacrifice, ","108":"And left (his hallowed memory) for posterity. ","109":"Peace be on Abraham. ","110":"That is how We reward those who do good. ","111":"He is truly among Our faithful creatures. ","112":"So We gave him the good news of Isaac, apostle, who is among the righteous. ","113":"And We blessed him and Isaac. Among their descendants are some who do good, but some who wrong themselves. ","114":"We were indeed gracious to Moses and Aaron, ","115":"And saved them and their people from great distress, ","116":"And helped them, so they were victorious. ","117":"We gave them the explicit Book, ","118":"And showed them the straight path, ","119":"And left (their remembrance) for posterity. ","120":"Peace be on Moses and Aaron. ","121":"That is how We reward those who do good. ","122":"They are among Our faithful devotees. ","123":"Verily Elias is one of the apostles. ","124":"When he said to his people: \"Will you not be mindful of God? ","125":"Would you call on Baal and leave the best of creators, ","126":"God, your Lord, and the Lord of your fathers?\" ","127":"They denied him, and will surely be brought to punishment, ","128":"Except the chosen creatures of God. ","129":"And We left his (memory) for posterity. ","130":"Peace be on Elias. ","131":"That is how We reward those who do good. ","132":"He is truly among Our faithful devotees. ","133":"Verily Lot was one of the apostles, ","134":"Wherefore We saved him and his entire family ","135":"Except an old woman who was one of those who stayed behind. ","136":"Then We destroyed the others. ","137":"You pass by (their habitations) in the morning ","138":"Or at night. Then how is it you do not understand? ","139":"Verily Jonah is one of the apostles. ","140":"When he fled on the laden ship, ","141":"And lots were cast (when a storm overtook them), he was rejected, (and thrown overboard). ","142":"Then he was swallowed by a large fish as he was worthy of blame. ","143":"Had he not been one of those who struggled hard, ","144":"He would have stayed in its belly till the day the dead are raised. ","145":"So We cast him, sick, on a barren shore, ","146":"And We made a gourd tree grow over him. ","147":"We sent him to a hundred thousand men or more, ","148":"And they came to believe; so We allowed them to enjoy the good things of life for an age. ","149":"Now ask them if their Lord has daughters, and they sons? ","150":"Or did We make the angels females, and they witnessed it? ","151":"Is it not a lie invented by them when they say: ","152":"\"God has begotten (children)?\" They are liars indeed! ","153":"Does He prefer sons to daughters? ","154":"What ails you that you judge in such a wise? ","155":"Why do you not reflect? ","156":"Or have you received some clear authority? ","157":"Then bring your scripture, if what you say is true. ","158":"They link Him with jinns by lineage, yet the jinns know they will be brought before Him. ","159":"God is too glorious for what they ascribe to Him ","160":"Except His chosen creatures who do not. ","161":"So neither you nor those you worship ","162":"Can mislead anyone away from Him, ","163":"Except one who is (destined) to burn in Hell. ","164":"\"There is not one of us who does not have his appointed place,\" (declare the angels.) ","165":"\"And we are truly those who stand in rows, ","166":"And we are those who sing hallelujas to Him.\" ","167":"They used to say: ","168":"If we had the account of earlier people with us, ","169":"We would have been the chosen creatures of God.\" ","170":"Yet now (that it has come) they refuse to believe in it; but they will come to know soon. ","171":"Our word had already been given before to Our votaries, the apostles, -- ","172":"That they would be helped, ","173":"And that certainly Our armies will be victorious. ","174":"So you ignore them for a time ","175":"And wait; they will come to know soon. ","176":"Do they want to hasten Our punishment? ","177":"When it comes down on their plains, it will be an evil dawn for those who had been warned. ","178":"So turn away from them for a time ","179":"And watch; they will come to know soon. ","180":"Too glorious is your Lord, the Lord of power, for what they ascribe to Him. ","181":"So peace be on the messengers, ","182":"And all praise to God, the Lord of all the worlds. "}}}
