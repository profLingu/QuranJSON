{"id":"68","name":"The Pen","verse":{"count":52,"data":{"1":"NUN. I CALL to witness the pen and what they inscribe, ","2":"You are not demented by the grace of your Lord. ","3":"There is surely reward unending for you, ","4":"For you are verily born of sublime nature. ","5":"So you will see, and they will realise, ","6":"Who is distracted. ","7":"Verily your Lord knows those who have gone astray from His path, and He knows those who are guided on the way. ","8":"So do not comply with those who deny: ","9":"They only want that you should relent, so that they may come to terms. ","10":"Do not heed a contemptible swearer, ","11":"Or backbiter, calumniator, slanderer, ","12":"Who hinders men from (doing) good, the transgressor, the iniquitous, ","13":"Crude, and above all, mean and infamous, ","14":"Simply because he possesses wealth and children. ","15":"When you recite Our revelations to him, he says: \"These are fables of long ago.\" ","16":"We shall brand him on the muzzle. ","17":"We have tried you as We tried the owners of the garden when they vowed to gather the fruits in the morning ","18":"But did not add: \"If God may please.\" ","19":"Then a calamity from your Lord fell upon it, but they remained fast asleep. ","20":"So by the morning it seemed as though picked clean. ","21":"At daybreak they called to each other: ","22":"\"If you want to gather the fruits, let us go early to the plantation.\" ","23":"So they departed, talking in low voices: ","24":"\"Let no needy person come to you within it today.\" ","25":"They left early in the morning bent on this purpose. ","26":"When they saw (and did not recognise it) they said: \"Surely we have lost the way. ","27":"No. In fact we have been deprived of it.\" ","28":"One who was temperate among them, said: \"Did I not say: \u00b4Why don\u00b4t you priase God?\u00b4\" ","29":"\"Glory to our Lord,\" they said; we were really in the wrong.\" ","30":"Then they started blaming one another, ","31":"Saying: \"Alas the woe, we were iniquitous. ","32":"Maybe our Lord will give us better than this. We turn to our Lord in supplication.\" ","33":"Such is Our chastisement; and the punishment of the Hereafter will be greater, if only they knew! ","34":"For those who fear God there are pleasure gardens with their Lord. ","35":"Should We treat those who submit and obey in the same way as those who are culpable? ","36":"What has come upon you that you judge in such a wise? ","37":"Or have you a Book in which you read ","38":"That you can surely have whatever you choose? ","39":"Or have you taken a binding promise from Us which would hold till the Day of Judgement, that you will get whatever you demand? ","40":"Ask them: \"Which of you is able to vouch for this?\" ","41":"Or have they any partners? Let them bring their partners then, if what they say is true. ","42":"On the day the great calamity befalls, and they are called to bow in homage, they will not be able to do so. ","43":"Lowered will be their eyes, disgrace overwhelming them. They had indeed been called to bow in homage when they were free of blame. ","44":"So leave those who deny this Discourse to Me. We shall lead them step by step to (ruin) in a way they will not know. ","45":"Yet I will give them respite: Surely My plan is compact. ","46":"Do you ask for any compensation from them that they are burdened with want? ","47":"Or do they have knowledge of the unknown which they copy down? ","48":"So wait with patience for the judgement of your Lord, and do not be like (onah) of the fish who called (to his Lord) when he was choked with anger. ","49":"Had it not been for a favour from his Lord he would have been cast blame-worthy on a barren plain. ","50":"Then his Lord chose him and placed him among the upright. ","51":"But the unbelievers would like to stare you out of balance when they hear the warning, and say: \"Surely he is possessed;\" ","52":"Whilst it is no more than reminder for the people of the world.
