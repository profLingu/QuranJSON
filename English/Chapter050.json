So the unbelievers say: \"This is astonishing: ","3":"When we are dead and turned to dust, this returning (to life) is most far-fetched.\" ","4":"We know what the earth consumes of them, for We have the Book that preserves everything. ","5":"But no! They called the truth a lie when it came to them; so they are in a confused state. ","6":"Have they not looked at the sky above them, how We have fashioned and adorned it, and it has no flaw? ","7":"We stretched the earth and placed upon it firm stabilisers and We made every kind of splendid thing to grow upon it ","8":"As instruction and reminder to every penitent creature. ","9":"And We send down water as a blessing from the sky, and grow gardens with it and the grain for harvest, ","10":"And tall date-palms with their spathes pile on pile ","11":"As a provision for men, and enlivened a region that was dead. Even thus will be the life after death. ","12":"The people of Noah, Ar-Rass and Thamud denied before you, ","13":"As did the people of \u00b4Ad and Pharaoh and the brethren of Lot, ","14":"And the dwellers of the Wood and people of Tubba\u00b4. Each of them denied the apostles. So My threat became a reality. ","15":"Were We exhausted by the act of the first creation? And yet they are confused about a new creation. ","16":"He created man and surely know what misdoubts arise in their hearts; for We are closer to him than his jugular vein. ","17":"When the two (angels) who keep the account, one sitting on the right, one on the left, take it down, ","18":"There is not a word he utters but an observer is ready (to make note of it). ","19":"The palsy of death will surely come. This is what you wished to avert. ","20":"And the trumpet blast will sound: It would be the Day of Doom. ","21":"Each soul will come with a driver and a witness. ","22":"(And the driver will say:) \"You were oblivious of this, so we have removed the veil, and how keen is your sight today!\" ","23":"His companion will say: \"Here is (the record) I have ready with me.\" ","24":"\"Cast each stubborn unbeliever into Hell,\" (they will be told), ","25":"\"Every obstructor of good, transgressor, and the sceptic, ","26":"Who had set up another god with God. Cast him into severe torment.\" ","27":"His companion will say: \"O Lord, I did not lead him to wickedness, but he was himself far astray.\" ","28":"\"Do not argue in My presence. I had announced the promise of doom in advance. ","29":"There is no changing of My word, nor am I unjust to My creatures.\"","30":"We shall ask Hell that day: \"Are you full?\" It will answer: \"Are there still more?\"","31":"And Paradise will be brought near, not far from those who took heed for themselves and feared God. ","32":"\"This is what you had been promised,\" (will be said) to every penitent who remembered (his duty), ","33":"Who feared Ar-Rahman in secret, and came with a penitent heart: ","34":"\"Enter it in peace. This is the day of life abiding.\" ","35":"Theirs will be whatsoever they wish: And with Us there is more. ","36":"How many generations have We destroyed before them who were mightier in power than they. Then they searched throughout the land to see if there was a way of escape. ","37":"Surely there is a reminder in this for whosoever has a heart (to feel), or takes heed. ","38":"We created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, in six spans, and no weariness came upon Us. ","39":"So you bear with patience what they say, and sing the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and its setting, ","40":"And glorify Him for some portion of the night, and additional adorations. ","41":"Take heed that the day the crier calls from a place close (to every one), ","42":"The day they actually hear the blast, will be the Day of rising of the dead. ","43":"We are the one who give life and death, and to Us will be the destination. ","44":"The day the earth will split asunder they will come out hurriedly. This gathering together is easy for Us. ","45":"We are cognisant of what they say; but it is not for you to compel them. So keep on reminding through the Qur\u00b4an whoever fears My warning. "}}}
